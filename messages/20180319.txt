Hello, Redis Geeks!

there's two types of people in the world: those who *love* Redis, and those who haven't worked with it yet! [1]
Thanks for joining our Singapore Meetup & User Group, we're building the community where people who are new to the world of distributed & web-scale computing are getting new ideas and can make connections with experienced folks who share their battle stories. Ultimately, we hope to help making the web a little better for everyone & have fun.

## FOSSASIA this week

Are you joining FOSSASIA this week? Let's do a meet & greet over lunch, RSVP here: https://www.meetup.com/Redis-SG/events/248654978/

## SPEAKERS WANTED

We've started planning for our first meetup, do reach out to me if you have an interesting topic. Are you using Redis in large project? We want to hear from you!

## LOOKING FOR SPONSORS & VENUE

Get in touch if you're keen to sponsor our first meetup - a great location will help, and who can say no to snacks & drinks.

Wishing you a fun & succcessful week ahead!

[1] in fact, there's two types of people in the world - those who divide the world into two types, and those who don't :-)
